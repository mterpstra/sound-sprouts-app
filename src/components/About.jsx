            The SOUND SPROUTS APP SERIES was designed as an extension of the 
            Sound Sprouts Book series. They can continue the discussion that 
            was started with the books OR can be the starting point as well. 
            Much like the books, we use child-friendly interactions to 
            facilitate speech sound development and language skills. Here&apos;s 
            how they work!

            - Each app has a set of target sounds that are the focus, giving 
            the user visual/auditory bombardment 

            -The set of sounds are known as cognates: meaning each set of 
            sounds has the same articulatory placement, one is voiced (loud) 
            and the other is voiceless (quiet).

            -Each app carefully uses child-friendly vocabulary with the 
            target sound in the initial, medial and final position of words, 
            giving the reader auditory bombardment.

            -The child is provided the opportunity to respond to different 
            questions, giving him/her the opportunity to produce the target 
            sounds in different positions of words. There are also teachable 
            moments with some of the vocabulary.

            -At the same time, the child will have the opportunity to respond 
            to who/what/where/why/how type questions, giving her/him the 
            opportunity to produce target sounds

            -Practice literacy skills such as: phonemic awareness, phonics, 
            rhyming, multiple meaning words, synonyms, compare/contrast. Oral 
            language is one of the pillars of literacy. 

            REMEMBER: Sounds make words, words make sentences, and sentences 
            can tell a story. Stories are a way for us to connect to others. 
            Communication gives us power to interact with others.
